# OpenCv-Adaptive_Kmeans_Clustering
Adaptive Kmeans Clustering written in C++ using OpenCv 3.0

Clustering is used to organize data for efficient retrieval. One
of the problems in clustering is the identification of clusters
in given data. A popular technique for clustering is based on
K-means such that the data is partitioned into K clusters.
In this method, the number of clusters is predefined and the technique
is highly dependent on the initial identification of elements
that represent the clusters well.
the technique can identify K clusters in an input data set by merging
existing clusters and by creating new ones while keeping the
number of clusters constant. The technique has been used to
achieve an impressive speedup of a search process when other
efficient search techniques may not be available.
